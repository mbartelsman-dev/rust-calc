# rust-calc

Simple command line calculator written in Rust that can handle arbitrary arithmetic operations.

The objective of this project is to serve as a valuable learning experience in the use of Rust and development in general, as such it aims to minimize the use of third party libraries wherever its reasonable to do so (implementing an efficient stack, for example, is better left for a different project).

## To do

- [ ] Implement evaluation
- [ ] Implement parentheses parsing
- [ ] Implement basic algebraic operators
  - [ ] Negative sign
  - [ ] Integer power
